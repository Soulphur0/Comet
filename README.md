# Comet 1.0.0

Comet is a mod that aims to give more life to those parts of the game that feel undeveloped, in a vanilla-friendly way, following logical design choices and trying to respect Vanilla Minecraft's design tendencies.

In this first release, Comet introduces new content to The End, in a way that tries to give a definitive answer to the controversy regarding this dimension's identity, and how to approach it when adding content.

<details>
<summary>Important notice</summary>
This first release contains a lot of concepts that can, and will, be developed upon in future versions. This mod is being released as an <b>ALPHA</b>, and while some features are almost completely fleshed out, it is likely for some others to not work as intended.<br><br>

If any issues, or compatibility problems arise during the gameplay with this mod, please, let me know through any of the communication channels I will provide you with below.

As a final note to this introduction notice, do not put any valuable world at risk with this mod, since some features are likely to be tweaked, specially The End's world generation. 

While in most cases the worst thing that could happen is losing this mod's items, The End dimension is influenced by a world generation datapack and some world generation custom code that will 100% worked upon a lot more in the future, and it's unpredictable if newer versions will adapt well enough to older world generation, which can lead to splitted terrain generation at the borders of old chunks.

# TLDR; What does this mod do?

1. If you haven't already, it'd be best for you to read the previous notice, thank you!

2. Added new blocks to The End's terrain generation with interesting new mechanics!
(When you think you've already found everything try using night vision)

3. Crystallization: transport mobs in a more convenient and vanilla-like way or turn them into decorative statues! You can also make crystallization potions to temporarily stun mobs, and even crystallize yourself!

4. Added a new mineral to The End, a tube-like formation of organic origin with its own unique way to look for! Not simply diggin' at low level altitudes! Make with it an armor set or the portal shield!

5. Much more content that you can check in the details below!

### Will a port for Forge ever be made?
I do have plans to personally port this mod to Forge, but notice that these plans are in the very long run. So please, bear in mind it won't happen anytime soon and refer to this notice when asking for a port.
Also,I might change my mind in the future and not port it myself, it's unlikely but not impossible.

License allows you to do it, and so do I. But notice that everyone has the right to port it to Forge, and even if ports were made by third parties I may eventually publish a port under the "Official Forge Port".
