# Comet 1.0.0

Comet is a mod that aims to give more life to those parts of the game that feel undeveloped, in a vanilla-friendly way, following logical design choices and trying to respect Vanilla Minecraft's design tendencies.

In this first release, Comet introduces new content to The End, in a way that tries to give a definitive answer to the controversy regarding this dimension's identity, and how to approach it when adding content.

If you have a little bit of time, I highly recommend you to watch the video embedded below to understand the design choices that were made in the making of this mod.

**Please notice:**<br>
This first release contains a lot of concepts that can, and will, be developed upon in future versions. This mod is being released as an ALPHA, and while some features are almost completely fleshed out, it is likely for some others to not work as intended.

If any issues, or compatibility problems arise during the gameplay with this mod, please, let me know through any of the communication channels I will provide you with below.

As a final note to this introduction notice, do not put any valuable world at risk with this mod, since some features are likely to be tweaked, specially The End's world generation. 

While in most cases the worst thing that could happen is losing this mod's items, The End dimension is influenced by a world generation datapack and some world generation custom code that will 100% worked upon a lot more in the future, and it's unpredictable if newer versions will adapt well enough to older world generation, which can lead to splitted terrain generation at the borders of old chunks.

# TLDR; What does this mod do?

1. If you haven't, please read the previous notice.

2. Added new blocks to The End's terrain generation with interesting new mechanics!
When you think you've already found everything try using night vision…

3. Crystallization: transport mobs in a more convenient and vanilla-friendly way or turn them into decorative statues! Or crystallize yourself to be invincible!!
Although you won't be able to move much…

4. Crystallization effect: Temporarily crystallize your enemies, this type of crystallization comes with its own separate characteristics from the aforementioned one.
Crunchy on the outside, but soft on the inside…

5. Added a new mineral to The End, a tube-like formation with organic origins and its own unique way to look for! Not simply diggin' at low level altitudes! 
With it, you can craft a new armor set and a very special shield…

6. New armor set! A netherite level armor with its own special attributes, focused on mobility and with its own minimalistic custom model! Antennas, rudders? And yes, you can wear elytras with it, of course you can! 
Meeting certain conditions that is…

7. The portal shield: deflect projectiles and teleport them back into your enemies! 
Looking at it is mesmerizing…

8. End fire! Catch on fire and teleport around like a flaming enderman would!
It still hurts though, you better be careful…

9. And some other blocks and mechanics that let you obtain or farm material to craft some  of the stuff already mentioned.

10. If you want to explore all the features this mod brings in more detail, please feel free to keep reading the mod's page where they are completely explained.

### Will a port for Forge ever be made?
I do have plans to personally port this mod to Forge, but notice that these plans are in the very long run. So please, bear in mind it won't happen anytime soon and refer to this notice when asking for a port.
Also,I might change my mind in the future and not port it myself, it's unlikely but not impossible.
